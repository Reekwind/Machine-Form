1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
    terraform {
      backend "remote" {
       # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
        organization = "UniformProcessing"

      # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
       workspaces {
       name = "UniformProcess-workspace"
      }
     }
   }

   # An example resource that does nothing.
  resource "-0b0" "VisualSpatialPosition" {
   triggers = {
    value = "+0"
    }
  }
